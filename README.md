# content-sync

**A GitHub Action to synchronize translatable content from Scientific Python projects to their corresponding translation repositories.**

This action automates the process of copying source content (e.g., HTML or Markdown files) from an upstream project repository into a dedicated translations repository. It is designed to work seamlessly with the [Scientific Python Translations](https://scientific-python-translations.github.io/) infrastructure and integrates with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) for managing translations.

---

## 📦 Features

- **Automated Content Syncing**: Periodically syncs specified folders from the source repository to the translations repository.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Supports specifying source repository, folder paths, branches, and more.
- **Integration with Crowdin**: Prepares content in a format suitable for Crowdin translation workflows.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Easily integrate into existing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository containing the source content you wish to translate.
- A separate translations repository set up to receive and manage translated content part of the Scientific Python Translations organization.
- GitHub Actions enabled on the translations repository.

## ⚙️ Usage

### Basic Example

Here's a sample GitHub Actions workflow that uses the `content-sync` action to sync content from the `main` branch of the `numpy/numpy.org` repository:

```yaml
name: Sync Content

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 12 * * MON" # Every Monday at noon
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Sync Pandas Content
        uses: Scientific-Python-Translations/content-sync@main
        with:
          source-repo: "numpy/numpy.org"
          source-path: "content/en/"
          source-ref: "main"
          translations-repo: "Scientific-Python-Translations/numpy.org-translations"
          translations-path: "content/"
          translations-source-path: "content/en/"
          translations-ref: "main"
          auto-merge: "false"
          # These are provided by the Scientific Python Project and allow
          # automation with bots
          gpg_private_key: ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          passphrase: ${{ secrets.PASSPHRASE }}
          token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
```

### Inputs

| Input                      | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source-repo`              | ✅       | —       | GitHub repo with the source content (e.g., `numpy/numpy.org`).                                                          |
| `source-path`              | ✅       | —       | Path to the content folder with respect to the source repo root (e.g., `content/en/`)                                   |
| `source-ref`               | ❌       | `main`  | Branch or tag to sync from.                                                                                             |
| `translations-repo`        | ✅       | —       | Target repo for translated content (e.g., `Scientific-Python-Translations/numpy.org-translations`).                     |
| `translations-path`        | ✅       | —       | Path to the folder where the translations will be synced with respect to translation repo root (e.g., `content/`).      |
| `translations-source-path` | ✅       | —       | Path to the folder where the source strings will be synced with respect to translation repo root (e.g., `content/en/`). |
| `translations-ref`         | ❌       | `main`  | Branch of the target translations repo.                                                                                 |
| `auto-merge`               | ❌       | `false` | Whether to auto-merge the created pull request.                                                                         |

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Translations Repository**: Set up a separate repository to hold the translated content. You can use the [translations-cookiecutter](https://github.com/Scientific-Python-Translations/translations-cookiecutter) as template for the repository.

2. **Configure Crowdin**: Integrate your translations repository with Crowdin to manage translations. Ensure that the translations paths are set up correctly for Crowdin.

3. **Set Up the Workflow**: Add the above GitHub Actions workflow to your source repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/sync-content.yml`). This is created automatically if you used the `translations-cookiecutter`.

**Important:** Any content that can be translated needs to live inside `translations-source-path`.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Checkout Source Repository**: The action checks out the specified `source-repo` and `source-ref`.

2. **Copy Content**: It copies the contents of `source-path` from the source repository.

3. **Checkout Translations Repository**: The action checks out the specified `translations-repo` and `translations-ref`.

4. **Place Synced Content**: It places the copied content into the specified `translations-source-path` within the translations repository.

5. **Commit and PR Creation**: The action commits the changes with the specified and creates a Pull Request with signed commits and performs and automatic merge if the option is enabled.

## 🤖 Bot Activity

All synchronization pull requests and automated commits are performed by the dedicated bot account:
